# AirBnB_clone

## Descriptions:

- This is the first step towards building AirBnB full web application clone.

* This command interpreter (console) is to manage the objects of the AirBnB web application:

1. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
3. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
4. Update attributes of an object
5. Destroy an object

## Whats in this command interpreter:

- BaseModel to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances.
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## Console usage:

## Environment:

This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

- Interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
```

- Non-interactive mode:

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
